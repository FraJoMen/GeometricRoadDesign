# Geometric Road Design

This project explores the mathematical and computational aspects of road geometric design, focusing on:

- **Planimetric curve transitions** (horizontal alignments)  
- **Altimetric curve transitions** (vertical alignments)  
- **Comprehensive road design verifications**  

Jupyter Notebooks are used to integrate theoretical concepts with practical applications, providing computational tools for analyzing and designing road alignments effectively.

The /notebooks folder contains Jupyter Notebooks developed for road geometric design.


## Notebooks

This project is a **work in progress**, and the `/notebooks` folder may not yet contain all the planned files. The expected Jupyter Notebooks include:  

- **Planimetric Curve Transitions**: Study of circular arcs, clothoids, and their representation in a Cartesian plane.
- **Altimetric Curve Transitions**: Analysis of vertical curves (concave and convex transitions).  
- **Road Design Verification**: Computational checks for road geometry compliance.  


## Installation

This project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and does not require local installation. You can access and execute the notebooks directly using Google Colab.  

To open a notebook in Google Colab, use the following link format:

We recommend installing the **Anaconda distribution** and downloading the files into the appropriate folder to execute them locally.
