# Geometric Road Design

## Overview

This project focuses on the mathematical and computational study of road geometric design, specifically:

- **Planimetric curve transitions** (horizontal alignments)  
- **Altimetric curve transitions** (vertical alignments)  
- **Comprehensive road design verifications**  

The project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks to facilitate both theoretical explanations and computational applications.

## Installation

This project is implemented using Jupyter Notebooks and does not require local installation. You can access and execute the notebooks directly using Google Colab.  

To open a notebook in Google Colab, use the following link format:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/GeometricRoadDesign/blob/main/notebooks/your-notebook.ipynb)  

We recommend installing the **Anaconda distribution** and downloading the files into the appropriate folder to execute them locally.  

## Notebooks

This project is a **work in progress**, and the `/notebooks` folder may not yet contain all the planned files. The expected Jupyter Notebooks include:  

- **Planimetric Curve Transitions**: Study of circular arcs, clothoids, and transition curves.  
- **Altimetric Curve Transitions**: Analysis of vertical curves (concave and convex transitions).  
- **Road Design Verification**: Computational checks for road geometry compliance.  

## Objective

Develop computational and design tools for geometric analysis of road infrastructures.
