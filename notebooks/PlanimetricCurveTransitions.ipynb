    "  The use of a **clothoid** as a transition curve ensures a gradual variation in curvature, improving both **safety** and **driving comfort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transitions between consecutive curves in the same direction**  \n",
    "  When two circular curves with different radii follow each other, a **clothoid transition** is necessary to avoid abrupt curvature changes.\n",

    "- **Transitions between consecutive curves in opposite directions (Flexure Clothoid)**  \n",
    "  When two curves of opposite direction follow each other, the design solution may include:  \n",
    "  - **An intermediate straight section**, ensuring enough separation to prevent abrupt maneuvers.  \n",
    "  - **A direct transition using a flexure clothoid**, allowing a **continuous variation of curvature** through a **zero-curvature point**.\n",

    "# 1. Straight Section Transitions Using Circular Arcs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we analyze the problem of connecting two straight road segments using a **circular arc**. This study is divided into two parts:\n",
    "- 1.1 Connecting straight sections with a circular arc\n",
    "- 1.2 Constraining the circular transition\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Connecting Straight Sections with a Circular Arc\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case consists of defining the geometry of a circular transition between two straight sections. This is characterized by the **coordinates of three key points** and the **radius R** of the circular arc:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P₀**: The starting point of the first straight section.\n",
    "- **P₁**: The intersection of the two straight sections.\n",
    "- **P₂**: The endpoint of the second straight section.\n",
    "- **R**: The prescribed radius of the circular arc, which influences the curvature and length of the transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transition Geometry Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the transition geometry, we first compute the **intersection angle (α)** at **P₁**, which determines the deflection between the two segments. Given **α** and the radius **R**, we derive:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Central angle (θ):** The circular arc's subtended angle at its center.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\theta = \\pi - \\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tangent length (T):** Distance from **P₁** to the arc's tangent points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$  T = R \\cdot \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bisector length (B):** Perpendicular distance from **P₁** to the arc's midpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$B = R  / \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates these relationships, which we will compute using the equations for θ, T, and B introduced above.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Computational Steps**\n",
    "To generate the circular transition, we perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compute the intersection angle (α)** between the two straight road sections.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the central angle (θ)**, which is the angle subtended by the circular arc at its center. This determines how much of the circle is used.\n",
    "3. **Determine the tangent length (T) and bisector length (B)** based on θ and R.\n",
    "4. **Find the center of the circular arc (O)** using the bisector method.\n",
    "5. **Determine the tangent points (T₁ and T₂)** where the circular arc connects to the straight sections.\n",
    "6. **Compute the coordinates of the circular arc** in the global reference system using parametric equations.\n",
    "7. **Visualize the transition** by plotting the arc along with the straight sections and key points.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these computational steps are implemented in the `CircularTransition` class, which is part of the `functions.py` module.  \n",

    "### Considerations on Tangent Points Position\n",
    "It is important to note that if the computed tangent length (T) is greater than the length of segments P₀P₁ or P₁P₂, the tangent points T₁ and T₂ will fall outside these segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly relevant in **3D modeling software**, where road alignments are often defined using **base polylines**. If a polyline segment is not long enough to accommodate a circular transition, the resulting geometry may become **inconsistent**, leading to undesired distortions or incorrect alignments in the model.\n",

    "## 1.2 Constraining the circular transition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we define the approach to determine the unique radius $R^*$ of a circular transition under specific geometric constraints. Instead of assigning $R^*$ arbitrarily, we derive it from fundamental geometric properties to ensure a systematic and precise design.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on two key cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Circle Passing Through a Specific Point $P_c$**  \n",
    "   The goal is to determine $R^*$ so that the circular transition passes through a given control point $P_c$. This is particularly useful in road alignment design, where specific waypoints must be respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Circle Tangent to a Constraining Tangent Segment (CTS)**  \n",
    "   The CTS acts as a boundary for the circular transition, limiting how far the curve extends. The goal is to compute $R^*$ so that the circle remains tangent to this segment, ensuring a controlled and precise transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will derive the mathematical expressions needed to compute $R^*$ for each case, forming the basis for computational algorithms that automate radius determination.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2.1 Circle Passing Through a Specific Point\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the unique radius $R^*$ such that the circular transition passes through a predefined point $P_c$, we consider the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The center $O$ of the circular transition must lie along the **bisector** of the angle formed by the two road segments.\n",
    "- The distance between $O$ and $P_c$ must be exactly $R^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously defined, $P_1$ represents the intersection of the two road segments and $\\alpha$ is the angle at $P_1$ between segments $P_0P_1$ and $P_1P_2$. To solve for $R^*$, we introduce the following characteristic angles of the triangle $P_c P_1 O$, as illustrated in the corresponding diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\theta$: The angle between vectors $P_1P_c$ and $P_1O$.\n",
    "- $\\varphi$: The angle at $P_c$ in the triangle $O P_c P_1$, which must always be greater than 90 degrees.\n",
    "- $\\gamma$: Computed as $\\gamma = \\varphi - \\theta - \\alpha/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the geometric analysis, we obtain the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sin(\\varphi) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\alpha /2)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From which we derive the radius $R^*$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^* = \\frac{\\|P_c - P_1\\| \\cdot \\sin(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\gamma)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\varphi$ must always be greater than 90 degrees, particular care must be taken when applying $\\arcsin(\\varphi)$ in computations to ensure the correct quadrant is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations are implemented in the method `CircularTransition.FixPoint` within the `functions.py` module, specifically developed to automate this calculation and ensure consistency in circular transition design.\n",
